### Early Life

I was always curious about technology while growing up. I was fortunate enough that from a young age I had access to a PC and the screeching sound of dial-up. I'm just barely old enough to remember it! I played a decent amount of video games as a kid, though I don't really remember the names of the games. As I grew older I started learning Excel formulas, mostly using the If function and conditional formatting.

### Education

Having access to a computer at a young age clearly gave me an advantage over my peers, I remember helping my class in year 1 (I think that means I was 5 or 6?) with copy/paste. This occasionally continued throughout the years to the point where I practically taught a lesson in sixth form (on Flash animation). My sixth form course was a BTEC in IT and at the time BTECs didn't include exams; it was just coursework. I finished my BTEC coursework ahead of schedule and used the time to learn python. Programming wasn't really taught in schools at the time, or at least not my school! After getting the basics down and programming my first console game noughts and crosses (it was no masterpiece, I assure you) I was invited by another teacher to help with assisting a class using SonicPi, a music application that runs on Raspberry Pis. Now, I could have used this time to study for my other classes but I knew I found my passion.

I decided to not go to university and that I'd pursue an IT apprenticeship. At the time, I wanted to find a software development apprenticeship but the opportunity never came around. Eventually, I was offered an interview by an apprenticeship job agency described as "something different" and after the interview I was giddy with excitement desperately hoping I made a good impression.

### Career

I started working at Avanade as an infrastructure apprentice in November 2013! I got the job! My apprenticeship framework meant that I was frequently rolled-on and rolled-off projects to do coursework, study at a centre, and sit certification exams. I gained insights into the vastness of the IT world and I was almost overwhelmed with choice of where to specialise. Many years later I've settled into the position of being an Azure infrastructure/security consultant. My skills are still quite broad and that's honestly the way I like it - I like the variety of projects I'm able to be involved in. If I was to say I'm a specialist in something it'll probably be ARM templates. I see ARM templates as a milestone in my career when I *really* begun to understand how Azure works.

### The Future

So, what do I want to achieve? I want to keep on leanin', that's for sure! Short term, my goal for 2022 is to attain all the fundamentals Microsoft certification (excluding Dynamics 365, sorry Dynamics). Long term, I would like to integrate into Azure networks and build my own following. The ultimate goal? I'd love to attain MVP - I'm just not sure how to get there, yet!
