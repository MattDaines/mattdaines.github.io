Growing up I was always very curious about technology. I was fortunate enough that from a young age I had access to a PC with the screeching sound of dial up. Yup. I remember it, despite being born in the mid-90s. I played plenty of games, I‚Äôm hard pressed to name any but I remember a Tonka game (maybe [Tonka Search Rescue](https://tonka.fandom.com/wiki/Tonka_Search_%26_Rescue)) and a racing game that I have a vague memory of having an issue with. Maybe it was the manual transmission. When I wasn‚Äôt playing a game, I would tinker with Excel formulas. I haven‚Äôt a clue what a 10-ish year old me would have been doing with Excel formulas but for my age I think I had a pretty solid grasp of if statements and the like. I spent quite a bit of time on the computer... Or consoles.

I went to schools in East London. While I was at primary school, they setup a new modern IT suite to teach ICT lessons - one of the first primary schools in the UK to receive such equipment. I remember helping my peers with copy-paste. That trend continued through to sixth form where I remember helping teach flash animation to not only my peers but my teacher. Toward the end of sixth form I realised I was fed up of formal education. I knew I had a passion for IT and I just wanted to get my hands on. I'd be lying if the cost of higher education didn't factor into that - I didn‚Äôt want to carry the university debt.

Instead of going to university I aimed for an apprenticeship in IT. I was originally aiming for a developer apprenticeship as I recently got into Python. Some time went by and I ended up at a consultancy where I still am now. I‚Äôve learnt an incredible amount in my time here and it never really stops. I consider myself extremely lucky ‚Äì not only do I genuinely love what I do, I‚Äôm thriving in an environment where I am able to invest in myself and continue learning.

I started this blog to document what I‚Äôve learnt (hopefully, not just how-to guides ‚Äì though I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôll be more than a few) and in my backlog of posts is ‚Äústuff‚Äù that I‚Äôm interested in knowing. The objective really for this blog is to encourage me to learn the content on my backlog and get it down on a post or a series. Anyway, if you‚Äôve made it this far, I‚Äôll spare you from further rambling. Hope you find something useful!
