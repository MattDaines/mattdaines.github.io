# Notebook

## What is this?

This site is really a brain dump for technology related things. I don't think I'm dedicated enough to commit to an _actual_ post on a blog, but I reckon I can commit to capturing knowledge on a notebook style site, like this! I'll try keep it organised, any maybe, one day, it'll help somebody other than myself!

## Who is it for?

At a minimum, just me. As best, every technologist. But that's optimistic. The reality is I'm hoping I can help myself by parking various bits of knowledge in a concise format and occasionally throw links over to folks that have questions.
